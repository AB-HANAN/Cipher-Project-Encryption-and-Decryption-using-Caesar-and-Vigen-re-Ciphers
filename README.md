# Cipher-Project-Encryption-and-Decryption-using-Caesar-and-Vigen-re-Ciphers
This project showcases basic implementations of the Caesar and Vigenère ciphers, two classical encryption techniques.

Caesar Cipher: A simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. This script allows you to both encrypt and decrypt messages by specifying the shift value.

Vigenère Cipher: A more complex cipher that uses a keyword to determine the shift for each letter in the plaintext. The script can encrypt and decrypt messages using a custom key, with the direction of encryption or decryption being controlled by a parameter.

The scripts are designed to handle both alphabetic characters and non-alphabetic characters, preserving the original message's structure.

You can customize this description further to match the style and details of your project.
